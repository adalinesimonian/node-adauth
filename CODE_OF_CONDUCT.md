# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct describes expectations for and consequences for the behaviour of any participants or contributors to adauth.

## Our Values

We believe in cultivating a culture of safety, respect, and trust. We find it essential to provide a harassment-free environment for all participants and contributors, regardless of ethnicity, race, gender identity or expression, appearance, disability, whether visible or invisible, sexual orientation or identity, education, or religion.

## Standards for Behaviour

Behaviour that creates a positive experience for the community:

- Respecting others and their viewpoints, opinions, and experiences.
- Respecting people's personal space, boundaries, privacy, and dignity.
- Being open to new ideas, perspectives and accepting and giving constructive criticism.
- Taking responsibility for your actions and being accountable for mistakes you make that affect others.
- Demonstrating kindness, courtesy, and empathy towards other people.

Unacceptable behaviour:

- Harassment, whether public or private, in any form.
- Using derogatory language or launching personal attacks on others.
- Sexual language, imagery, or advances of any kind.
- Threatening or promoting violence against other people.
- Using people's identities as a pretext to attack them.

## Consequences and Accountability

We commit to a zero-tolerance policy for harassment and to taking appropriate action to keep others safe. Any person violating these standards may be banned from the community or lose access to the repository. Violating comments, code, issues, pull requests, discussions, or other content may be removed.

Political beliefs are not protected and may be used to justify actions. Fascism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and other forms of discrimination will result in immediate expulsion from the community.

Offending behaviour outside of the repository's scope, such as in public spaces, social media, or private communications between users, may still result in a loss of access to the repository.

## Enforcement

If you are being harassed or have noticed behaviour that violates this code of conduct, please contact Adaline at [adalinesimonian@gmail.com](mailto:adalinesimonian@gmail.com). We will respond to your report as promptly as possible.
